**Lesson 10: The Logic Olympics**

**1\. Concept Overview (Brief Recap):**

**(Narrator, perhaps Alex, addresses the students):**

"Congratulations, young logicians\! You've journeyed through Trueland and Falseville, met wizards and detectives, explored magical mirrors and wishing wells, and even visited the Fallacy Fair\! You've learned so much about logic:

* **Statements:** Sentences that are either true or false.  
* **NOT (Negation):** Making a statement its opposite.  
* **AND (Conjunction):** Both parts must be true.  
* **OR (Disjunction):** At least one part must be true.  
* **IF...THEN... (Conditional Statements):** A promise between two parts.  
* **Arguments:** Premises leading to a conclusion.  
* **Valid vs. Invalid Arguments:** Good structure vs. flawed structure.  
* **Logical Fallacies:** Sneaky errors in reasoning (hasty generalization, appeal to emotion).

Today, we're going to put all that knowledge to the test in the Logic Olympics\! Get ready for challenges that will test your skills in every area of logic we've explored."

**2\. Activities (Logic Olympics Events):**

The Logic Olympics will consist of several "events," each focusing on a different logical concept. You can adapt the number and type of events based on time and student needs.

**Event 1: True/False Sprint**

* **Concept:** Statements and Truth Values (Lesson 1).  
* **Materials:** Flashcards with statements (mix of true, false, and some that are open to interpretation, to spark discussion).  
* **Instructions:**  
  1. The teacher reads statements rapidly.  
  2. Students respond with "True" or "False" (using hand signals, response cards, or verbally).  
  3. Include some debatable statements to encourage discussion about assumptions and interpretations.

**Event 2: Negation Relay**

* **Concept:** Negation (Lesson 2).  
* **Materials:** Sentence strips with simple statements. Two "stations" representing "Original Statement" and "Negation."  
* **Instructions:**  
  1. Divide students into teams.  
  2. One student from each team runs to the "Original Statement" station, picks a sentence strip, and reads it aloud.  
  3. They run to the "Negation" station and *verbally* state the negation of the sentence.  
  4. If correct, they tag the next team member.  
  5. The first team to correctly negate all their statements wins.

**Event 3: AND/OR Obstacle Course**

* **Concept:** Conjunction and Disjunction (Lessons 3 & 4).  
* **Materials:**  
  1. Objects with different characteristics (color, shape, size, etc.).  
  2. "Obstacle" cards with "AND" or "OR" conditions (e.g., "Find an object that is red AND round," "Find an object that is blue OR small").  
* **Instructions:**  
  1. Set up a small obstacle course.  
  2. At each "obstacle," students must find an object that meets the condition on the card before they can proceed.  
  3. Vary the conditions, using both "AND" and "OR."

**Event 4: If-Then Challenge**

* **Concept:** Conditional Statements (Lessons 5 & 6).  
* **Materials:** Cards with "IF..." sentence starters, cards with "THEN..." sentence endings.  
* **Instructions:**  
  1. Students work individually or in pairs.  
  2. They draw an "IF..." card and a "THEN..." card.  
  3. They have to combine the two parts to form a complete.

**Event 5: Argument Clinic Diagnosis**

* **Concept:** Valid/Invalid Arguments, Fallacies (Lessons 7, 8, & 9).  
* **Materials:** Cards with short arguments (some valid, some invalid, some containing fallacies).  
* **Instructions:**  
  1. Students (individually or in teams) receive an argument card.  
  2. They must "diagnose" the argument:  
     * Is it valid or invalid?  
     * Does it contain a fallacy (hasty generalization or appeal to emotion)?  
     * Explain their reasoning.

**Event 6: Logic Grid Puzzle (Age-Appropriate)**

* **Concept:** Applying multiple logical concepts to solve a problem.  
* **Materials:** Age-appropriate logic grid puzzles (printed or projected). Many free resources are available online. Examples for 8-year-olds might involve:  
  1. Matching pets to owners and houses based on clues.  
  2. Figuring out what each person ordered for lunch based on clues.  
  3. Determining the order in which children finished a race based on clues.  
* **Instructions:**  
  1. Explain the rules of logic grid puzzles.  
  2. Students work individually or in pairs to solve the puzzle.  
  3. Provide guidance as needed, encouraging students to use the logical concepts they've learned.

**Event 7: Create-Your-Own Logic Puzzle**

* **Concept:** Synthesizing all learned concepts.  
* **Materials:** paper, pencils.  
* **Instructions**  
  1. Students are tasked to create their own logic puzzle. They can take inspiration from previous lessons.

**3\. Closing Ceremony:**

* **Award Ceremony:** Award certificates or small prizes for participation and achievement in the Logic Olympics. Emphasize effort and learning over winning.  
* **Review:** Briefly recap the key concepts covered throughout the curriculum.  
* **Encouragement:** Encourage students to continue practicing their logical thinking skills in everyday life.
