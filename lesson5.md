**Lesson 5: The Magical Wishing Well of If-Then**

**1\. Story: The Magical Wishing Well of If-Then**

**(Narrator begins, referencing past lessons if desired):**

"Alex, our explorer, had learned so much about logic\! Today, Alex discovered something truly amazing: The Magical Wishing Well of If-Then. This well didn't grant just *any* wish; it granted wishes that followed a special rule: an 'IF...THEN...' rule.

A sign on the well read: 'To make a wish, you must say it in the form: IF \[something is true\], THEN \[something else will happen\].'

Alex thought for a moment. Then, Alex carefully said, 'IF I drop a coin in the well, THEN I will make a wish come true.' Alex dropped a coin into the well, and *poof\!* – a small, toy unicorn appeared\! The well had followed the 'IF...THEN...' rule.

A little rabbit hopped up to the well. The rabbit said, 'IF I sing a song, THEN I will get a carrot.' The rabbit sang a sweet little tune, and *pop\!* – a juicy carrot appeared\!

Then, a grumpy bear lumbered up. The bear grumbled, 'I want a fish\!'

The well remained silent. Nothing happened.

Alex realized why. The bear hadn't used the 'IF...THEN...' rule\! The well only understood wishes in that special form. It's like a secret code.

The bear, after some prompting from Alex, tried again. This time, the bear said, 'IF I clap my paws three times, THEN I will get a fish.' The bear clapped three times, and *splash\!* – a delicious-looking fish landed right in front of him.

Alex learned that the Wishing Well was teaching a valuable lesson about *conditional statements*. These statements have two parts:

* The 'IF' part: This is called the *hypothesis* (or the condition). It's something that might be true or false.  
* The 'THEN' part: This is called the *conclusion*. It's what happens *if* the 'IF' part is true.

It's like a promise: *If* the first part happens, *then* the second part will happen. The Wishing Well always kept its promise\!"

**2\. Activities:**

**Activity 1: Wishing Well Role-Play**

* **Objective:** To physically act out and understand the structure of conditional statements.  
* **Materials:**  
  1. A "well" (can be a bucket, a box, or just a designated area).  
  2. Small objects or treats to represent "wishes granted" (e.g., stickers, small toys, pictures).  
* **Instructions:**  
  1. **Review the Story:** Briefly recap the story of the Magical Wishing Well, emphasizing the "IF...THEN..." rule.  
  2. **Teacher as Well:** The teacher acts as the "Wishing Well."  
  3. **Student Wishes:** Students take turns making wishes in the "IF...THEN..." format. They should be simple and achievable within the classroom context (e.g., "IF I stand on one leg, THEN I will get a sticker," "IF I say 'please,' THEN I will get a high-five").  
  4. **Well Responds:**  
     * If the student uses the correct "IF...THEN..." format *and* fulfills the "IF" part, the teacher (as the well) grants the "THEN" part.  
     * If the student doesn't use the correct format, the teacher explains that the well doesn't understand.  
     * If the student uses the correct format but *doesn't* fulfill the "IF" part, the teacher explains that the condition wasn't met.  
  5. **Discussion:** Discuss each wish and why it was or wasn't granted, focusing on the structure of the conditional statement.

**Activity 2: If-Then Sentence Completion**

* **Objective:** To practice completing conditional statements.  
* **Materials:**  
  1. Sentence strips or index cards.  
  2. Markers.  
* **Instructions:**  
  1. **Review:** Remind students of the "IF...THEN..." structure.  
  2. **Sentence Starters:** Write "IF..." sentence starters on cards (e.g., "IF it rains...", "IF I study hard...", "IF I eat my vegetables...", "IF the sun shines...").  
  3. **Student Completion:** Students select a card and complete the sentence with a logical "THEN..." part.  
  4. **Sharing and Discussion:** Students share their completed sentences. Discuss whether the "THEN" part is a reasonable consequence of the "IF" part.  
  5. **Variation:** Provide "THEN..." sentence endings and have students create the "IF..." part.

**Activity 3: Drawing Conditional Scenarios**

* **Objective:** To visually represent conditional statements.  
* **Materials:**  
  1. Paper.  
  2. Crayons or markers.  
* **Instructions:**  
  1. **Teacher Prompts:** The teacher provides "IF...THEN..." statements (e.g., "IF a cat sees a mouse, THEN it will chase it," "IF a plant gets water, THEN it will grow," "IF you drop a glass, THEN it might break").  
  2. **Student Drawings:** Students draw a picture (or a series of pictures) that illustrates the conditional statement. They should show both the "IF" part and the "THEN" part.  
  3. **Sharing and Explanation:** Students share their drawings and explain how they represent the conditional statement.  
  4. **Extension**: Students can be prompted to write their drawing in a sentence.

These activities introduce conditional statements in a playful and accessible way, focusing on the "IF...THEN..." structure and the relationship between the hypothesis and conclusion. The emphasis is on understanding the *meaning* of the conditional, rather than formal logic rules or truth tables, which will come in later lessons. The activities are designed to be engaging and to encourage students to think critically about cause and effect.
