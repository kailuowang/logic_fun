**1\. Story: The Case of the Missing Cookies**

**(Narrator begins, perhaps with a visual aid like a drawing of a cookie jar):**

"Alex, our logic expert, was visiting a friend's house. Suddenly, there was a cry: 'The cookies are gone\!' A plate of freshly baked cookies had mysteriously disappeared from the kitchen table. It was time to put on a detective hat and build an *argument* to solve the mystery\!

Alex knew that an argument is like building a case. You start with *premises* – these are statements that you believe are true, like clues. Then, based on those premises, you reach a *conclusion* – what you think happened, based on the clues.

The first person Alex interviewed was the family dog, Sparky (using a bit of imagination, of course\!). Alex gathered these premises:

* **Premise 1:** Sparky loves cookies. (Everyone knew this was true\!)  
* **Premise 2:** Sparky was in the kitchen. (The mom saw him there earlier.)  
* **Premise 3:** If Sparky is in the kitchen and there are cookies, Sparky will try to eat the cookies.

Based on these premises, Alex formed a *conclusion*:

* **Conclusion:** Sparky probably ate the cookies\!

Alex explained: 'We know Sparky loves cookies, and he was in the kitchen, and he always goes after a snack within reach. So, putting it all together, it's likely he's the culprit\!'

Then, Alex talked to the little sister, Lily. Lily gave these premises:

* **Premise 1:** Lily said she saw a bluebird fly in through the open window.  
* **Premise 2:** Bluebirds don't eat chocolate chip cookies.

From these premises, Lily formed a conclusion:

* **Conclusion:** The bluebird did *not* eat the cookies.

Finally, Alex talked to the older brother, Tom.

* **Premises 1:** If Tom ate the cookies, he would have crumbs on this shirt.  
* **Premises 2:** Tom does not have crumbs on is shirt.  
* **Conclusion:** Tom did not eat the cookies.

Alex learned that an argument is like a chain of reasoning. You start with your premises – the things you believe are true. Then, you use those premises to reach a conclusion – a statement that you believe is true *because* of the premises. A good argument makes the conclusion seem likely, based on the premises. A weak argument has premises that don't really support the conclusion."

**2\. Activities:**

**Activity 1: Building Arguments (Object-Based)**

* **Objective:** To physically construct simple arguments using objects as premises.  
* **Materials:**  
  1. Various objects (e.g., toys, blocks, fruits).  
  2. Cards labeled "Premise 1," "Premise 2," and "Conclusion."  
* **Instructions:**  
  1. **Review the Story:** Briefly recap the story of the missing cookies, emphasizing the concepts of premises and conclusions.  
  2. **Set Up:** Place the "Premise 1," "Premise 2," and "Conclusion" cards on a table.  
  3. **Teacher-Led Example:** The teacher creates a simple argument using objects. For example:  
     * **Premise 1:** (Place a red block on the "Premise 1" card) "This block is red."  
     * **Premise 2:** (Place a similar red block on the "Premise 2" card) "This block is also red."  
     * **Conclusion:** (Place both blocks together on the "Conclusion" card) "Therefore, both blocks are red."  
  4. **Student Arguments:** Students take turns creating their own simple arguments using the objects and cards. Encourage them to explain their reasoning.  
  5. **Discussion:** Discuss whether the conclusions follow logically from the premises.

**Activity 2: Story Argument Identification**

* **Objective:** To identify premises and conclusions within short stories.  
* **Materials:**  
  1. Short, simple stories with clear arguments (either pre-written or created by the teacher). Examples:  
     * "The cat was meowing loudly. Cats meow when they are hungry. Therefore, the cat was probably hungry."  
     * "The ground was wet. It rains when the ground is wet. Therefore it probably rained"  
     * "The light was on in the room. Someone must have turned it on. Therefore, someone was in the room."  
* **Instructions:**  
  1. **Read Aloud:** The teacher reads a story aloud.  
  2. **Identify Premises:** Ask students to identify the premises – the statements that are presented as facts or evidence.  
  3. **Identify Conclusion:** Ask students to identify the conclusion – the statement that is being argued for, based on the premises.  
  4. **Discussion:** Discuss how the premises lead to the conclusion. Ask students if they agree with the conclusion, and why or why not.

**Activity 3: Create-Your-Own Mystery**

* **Objective:** To apply the concepts of premises and conclusions to create a simple mystery and argument.  
* **Materials:**  
  1. Paper.  
  2. Pencils or crayons.  
* **Instructions:**  
  1. **Brainstorm:** As a class (or in small groups), brainstorm a simple mystery scenario (e.g., a missing toy, a broken vase, a spilled juice).  
  2. **Develop Premises:** Students create at least two premises that relate to the mystery.  
  3. **Formulate Conclusion:** Students write a conclusion that is supported by their premises.  
  4. **Share and Solve:** Students share their mysteries and arguments with the class. The class can try to "solve" the mystery based on the provided premises and conclusion.  
  5. **Extension**: Include a conditional.
