# Logic Fun - Interactive Logic Learning for Children

This is a simple HTML and JavaScript application designed to teach children about formal logic concepts in a fun and interactive way.

## Current Lessons

### Lesson 1: The Land of Trueland and Falseville
An introduction to the concept of statements and truth values through a fun story and interactive activities.

### Lesson 2: The Magic Mirror of Falseville
Teaches the concept of negation ("NOT") and how it affects the truth value of statements through an engaging story about a magic mirror.

### Lesson 3: The Two-Ingredient Potion of Trueland
Introduces conjunction ("AND") through a story about a wizard who makes potions that require two perfect ingredients to work.

### Lesson 4: The Choice Garden of Trueland
Teaches disjunction ("OR") through a story about a magical garden that can be entered if visitors have at least one of two special items.

### Lesson 5: The Magical Wishing Well of If-Then
Introduces conditional statements ("IF-THEN") through a story about a magical wishing well that grants wishes in a specific format.

### Lesson 6: The Detective of If-Thenville
Explores logical reasoning with conditional statements through a detective story, teaching children to draw valid conclusions from IF-THEN statements.

### Lesson 7: The Case of the Missing Cookies
Introduces logical arguments, premises, and conclusions through a mystery story about missing cookies and different suspects.

### Lesson 8: The Argument Clinic
Teaches the difference between valid and invalid arguments through a story about a special clinic where doctors examine and diagnose arguments based on their logical structure.

### Lesson 9: The Fallacy Fair
Introduces common logical fallacies through a story about a fair where vendors showcase flawed reasoning patterns, focusing on hasty generalizations and appeals to emotion.
