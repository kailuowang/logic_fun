# Logic Fun - Interactive Logic Learning for Children

This is a simple HTML and JavaScript application designed to teach children about formal logic concepts in a fun and interactive way.

## Current Lessons

### Lesson 1: The Land of Trueland and Falseville
An introduction to the concept of statements and truth values through a fun story and interactive activities.

### Lesson 2: The Magic Mirror of Falseville
Teaches the concept of negation ("NOT") and how it affects the truth value of statements through an engaging story about a magic mirror.

### Lesson 3: The Two-Ingredient Potion of Trueland
Introduces conjunction ("AND") through a story about a wizard who makes potions that require two perfect ingredients to work.

### Lesson 4: The Choice Garden of Trueland
Teaches disjunction ("OR") through a story about a magical garden that can be entered if visitors have at least one of two special items.

### Lesson 5: The Magical Wishing Well of If-Then
Introduces conditional statements ("IF-THEN") through a story about a magical wishing well that grants wishes in a specific format.

### Lesson 6: The Detective of If-Thenville
Explores logical reasoning with conditional statements through a detective story, teaching children to draw valid conclusions from IF-THEN statements.

## Features

- Engaging stories about Trueland, Falseville, the Magic Mirror, the Two-Ingredient Potion, the Choice Garden, the Magical Wishing Well, and the Detective of If-Thenville
- Interactive activities:

    - Activity 1: Statement sorting (identifying statements vs. non-statements)
    - Activity 2: True or False identification
    - Activity 3: Creating your own statements
  - Lesson 2:
    - Activity 1: Mirror, Mirror (creating negations interactively)
    - Activity 2: NOT Card Matching Game (matching statements with their negations)
    - Activity 3: Drawing the Opposite (visualizing negation through drawing)
  - Lesson 3:
    - Activity 1: Potion Ingredients Game (understanding when "AND" statements are true)
    - Activity 2: "AND" Sentence Builders (creating and evaluating compound statements)
    - Activity 3: Venn Diagram for "AND" (visualizing how "AND" works using overlapping sets)
  - Lesson 4:
    - Activity 1: Garden Gate Game (understanding when "OR" statements are true)
    - Activity 2: "OR" Sentence Builders (creating and evaluating compound statements with OR)
    - Activity 3: Venn Diagram for "OR" (visualizing how "OR" works and comparing with "AND")
  - Lesson 5:
    - Activity 1: Wishing Well Role-Play (creating wishes using the IF-THEN format)
    - Activity 2: If-Then Sentence Completion (completing conditional statements)
    - Activity 3: Drawing Conditional Scenarios (visualizing cause and effect relationships)
  - Lesson 6:
    - Activity 1: Detective Clues (drawing conclusions from conditional statements and evidence)
    - Activity 2: Conditional Consequences (exploring the chain of events following from conditions)
    - Activity 3: Breaking the Promise (determining when conditional statements are respected or broken)

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Read through the story

## Future Development

This application can be extended with additional lessons covering more advanced logic concepts like:
- Biconditionals (IF AND ONLY IF statements)
- Exclusive OR (XOR statements)
- Basic deductive reasoning and syllogisms
- Formal logical proofs
- Logical fallacies
- Set theory and Venn diagrams
