**Lesson 6: The Detective of If-Thenville**

**1\. Story: The Detective of If-Thenville**

**(Narrator begins, linking to the previous lesson if desired):**

"Alex, after learning about the Wishing Well, traveled to a new town: If-Thenville\! This town was full of detectives who used 'IF...THEN...' statements to solve mysteries. The best detective in town was Detective Dana, and Alex was eager to learn from her.

Detective Dana was working on a case. She had a clue: 'IF the burglar wore gloves, THEN there will be no fingerprints.' This was her main *conditional statement*.

Detective Dana went to the scene of the crime â€“ a bakery\! She looked carefully. There were *no* fingerprints anywhere\!

'Aha\!' said Detective Dana. 'The clue said, "IF the burglar wore gloves, THEN there will be no fingerprints." There are *no* fingerprints. This strongly suggests the burglar *did* wear gloves\!' (This is a valid inference, *Modus Ponens*, but we don't name it yet).

Then, Detective Dana found another clue. This one said: 'IF the baker was sleeping, THEN he didn't hear the burglar.'

Detective Dana interviewed the baker. The baker said, 'I was wide awake\! I was baking bread all night\!'

'Hmm,' thought Detective Dana. 'The clue said, "IF the baker was sleeping, THEN he didn't hear the burglar." But the baker was *not* sleeping. That means I can't be sure, the second part is not informatif.'

Later, a witness came forward. The witness said, 'I saw the burglar\! He definitely *wasn't* wearing gloves\!'

Detective Dana revisited her first clue: 'IF the burglar wore gloves, THEN there will be no fingerprints.' The witness said the burglar did *not* wear gloves. 'So,' thought Dana, 'there *should* be fingerprints\! Let's look again\!' (This uses the *negation* of the "if" part).

This time, examining a different part of the counter, she found faint fingerprints\! The witness was right\! The lack of gloves led to fingerprints being found, confirming the conditional statement.

Alex learned that 'IF...THEN...' statements are powerful tools for detectives. They help you think about what *should* happen if something is true, and what you can conclude if you know something about the 'IF' part or the 'THEN' part. But you have to be careful\! Knowing the 'THEN' part is false tells you something about the 'IF' part, but knowing the 'THEN' part is true doesn't *always* tell you for sure about the 'IF' part.' (This is a key distinction to prepare for later lessons on invalid arguments)."

**2\. Activities:**

**Activity 1: Detective Clues (Role-Playing)**

* **Objective:** To practice reasoning with conditional statements in a simulated detective scenario.  
* **Materials:**  
  1. "Clue" cards with conditional statements (e.g., "IF it rained last night, THEN the ground will be wet," "IF the dog barked, THEN someone was at the door," "IF the cookies are gone, THEN someone ate them").  
  2. "Evidence" cards with statements that relate to the "IF" or "THEN" parts of the clues (e.g., "The ground is wet," "The dog did not bark," "The cookies are still there," "Someone ate the cookies").  
  3. (Optional) Detective hats, magnifying glasses.  
* **Instructions:**  
  1. **Review the Story:** Briefly recap the story of Detective Dana, emphasizing how she used conditional statements.  
  2. **Set Up:** Divide students into small groups (or work as a whole class). Give each group a "Clue" card and an "Evidence" card.  
  3. **Detective Work:** Students act as detectives, using their clue and evidence to draw a conclusion.  
  4. **Discussion:** Each group shares their clue, evidence, and conclusion. Discuss whether their reasoning is valid, based on the conditional statement. Focus on these patterns:  
     * **IF P THEN Q. P is true. Therefore, Q is true.** (Valid \- like the glove example)  
     * **IF P THEN Q. Q is false. Therefore, P is false.** (Valid \- like the baker example)  
     * **IF P THEN Q. Q is true. Therefore, P is true.** (Invalid \- Introduce this gently; explain that it's *possible* P is true, but not *certain*. There might be other reasons Q is true.)  
     * **If P Then Q. P is not true. Therefor Q is not true.** (Invalid \- Gently introduce)  
  5. Emphasize that we are not to introduce those formal term yet.

**Activity 2: Conditional Consequences (Chain Reactions)**

* **Objective:** To explore the consequences of fulfilling or not fulfilling the "IF" part of a conditional statement.  
* **Materials:**  
  1. Paper.  
  2. Markers or crayons.  
* **Instructions:**  
  1. **Start with a Conditional:** The teacher (or a student) provides a conditional statement (e.g., "IF you water a plant, THEN it will grow").  
  2. **Scenario 1 (IF is True):** Students draw (or write) what happens if the "IF" part is true (the plant is watered). They then extend the chain of consequences (e.g., "The plant grows. THEN it produces flowers. THEN bees come to the flowers...").  
  3. **Scenario 2 (IF is False):** Students draw (or write) what happens if the "IF" part is false (the plant is *not* watered). They then extend the chain of consequences (e.g., "The plant does not grow. THEN it wilts. THEN it dies...").  
  4. **Comparison:** Compare the two scenarios, highlighting how the truth or falsehood of the "IF" part dramatically changes the outcome.

**Activity 3: Breaking the Promise (Identifying Broken Conditionals)**

* **Objective:** To practice to know when a conditional is respected or not.  
* **Materials:**  
  4. Prepared cards.  
* **Instructions:**  
  4. **Review:** Review the story of the detective and the clues.  
  5. **Cards preparation:** Cards should includes those elements: a conditional written, a situation.  
  6. **Example:**  
  7. "IF you press the button, THEN the light will turn on". Situation: press button, light does not turn on. The conditional is disrespected.  
  8. "IF you water the plant, THEN it will grow". Situation: no water, plant grows. Conditional is respected.  
  9. **Discussion:** Encourage students to explain *why*.

These activities build on the previous lesson by exploring the consequences of conditional statements in more depth. The focus is on valid reasoning patterns and the importance of considering both the "IF" and "THEN" parts. The activities encourage critical thinking and help students understand how conditional statements can be used to make predictions and draw conclusions, setting the stage for future lessons on arguments and validity.
