**Lesson 1: The Land of Trueland and Falseville**

**1\. Story: The Land of Trueland and Falseville**

**(Narrator begins, perhaps with a simple map drawn on a whiteboard or large paper showing two distinct lands):**

"Once upon a time, far, far away, there were two very special lands: Trueland and Falseville. In Trueland, everything that everyone said was *always* true. The sun shone brightly, the birds sang sweetly, and the flowers were always in bloom. If someone in Trueland said, 'The grass is green,' you *knew* it was absolutely, positively green\!

But right next door was Falseville. And in Falseville, everything was…well, the opposite\! Everything everyone said was *always* false. If someone in Falseville said, 'The sky is orange,' you could be sure it was definitely *not* orange\! It was probably blue, or maybe even purple\!

One day, a little explorer named Alex decided to visit both lands. Alex loved to figure things out. Alex carried a special notebook, and whenever someone said something, Alex would write it down and decide if it belonged in Trueland or Falseville. These things Alex wrote down were called *Statements*. A Statement is something special: it can only live in *one* of these lands. It has to be either TRUE or FALSE.

For example, in Trueland, a friendly baker said, 'My cookies are delicious\!' Alex tasted one – and it was the tastiest cookie ever\! So, Alex wrote down, 'The baker's cookies are delicious,' and put a big 'T' for True next to it. That was a *Statement*, and it belonged in Trueland.

Then, Alex hopped over to Falseville. A grumpy-looking goblin said, 'I have ten noses\!' Alex looked closely. The goblin only had *one* nose\! So, Alex wrote down, 'The goblin has ten noses,' and put a big 'F' for False next to it. That was a *Statement* too, but it belonged in Falseville.

But then, Alex heard some things that were *not* Statements. Someone in Trueland asked, 'What time is it?' Alex realized that wasn't true or false – it was a question\! And in Falseville, a troll shouted, 'Go away\!' That wasn't true or false either – it was a command\! Questions and commands aren't Statements. They don't live in Trueland or Falseville. They're different.

Alex learned that Statements are special sentences that tell us something that can be checked to see if it's true or false. They're like little clues that help us understand the world\!"

**2\. Activities:**

**Activity 1: Statement Sort (Trueland/Falseville Boxes)**

* **Objective:** To distinguish between statements and non-statements (questions, commands, exclamations).  
* **Materials:**  
  1. Two boxes or containers, clearly labeled "Trueland" and "Falseville."  
  2. Pre-written cards with sentences on them (mix of statements and non-statements). Examples:  
     * "The cat is sleeping." (Statement)  
     * "Is it raining?" (Question)  
     * "Close the door\!" (Command)  
     * "Wow, that's amazing\!" (Exclamation)  
     * "The apple is red." (Statement)  
     * "Do you like pizza?" (Question)  
     * "Apples are blue." (Statement)  
     * "Stop that at once" (Command)  
  3. (Optional) Pictures to accompany some of the sentences, especially for visual learners.  
* **Instructions:**  
  1. **Review the Story:** Briefly recap the story of Trueland and Falseville, emphasizing the definition of a statement.  
  2. **Explain the Boxes:** Show the students the Trueland and Falseville boxes. Explain that we're going to sort sentences.  
  3. **Card Reading:** The teacher (or a student) reads a sentence from a card aloud.  
  4. **Class Discussion:** The class discusses whether the sentence is a statement (something that can be true or false) or not.  
  5. **Sorting:** If it's a statement, a student places the card in *either* Trueland OR Falseville (it doesn't matter which for this activity, the point is to identify it *as* a statement). If it's *not* a statement, the card is set aside (perhaps in a "Not Statements" pile).  
  6. **Repeat:** Continue with the remaining cards. Encourage students to explain *why* they think a sentence is or is not a statement.

**Activity 2: True or False Flashcards**

* **Objective:** To practice identifying the truth value of simple statements.  
* **Materials:**  
  1. Flashcards with simple statements written on them. These should be clearly true or false. Examples:  
     * "The sun is hot." (True)  
     * "Pigs can fly." (False)  
     * "Water is wet." (True)  
     * "Grass is purple." (False)  
     * "Dogs have tails." (True, generally, address exceptions if they come up)  
     * "The moon is made of cheese." (False)  
     * "1 \+ 1 \= 2." (True)  
     * "5 is bigger than 10" (False)  
  2. (Optional) Pictures to accompany the statements.  
* **Instructions:**  
  1. **Review Statements:** Remind students that a statement is something that can be true or false.  
  2. **Flashcard Presentation:** The teacher holds up a flashcard and reads the statement aloud.  
  3. **True/False Response:** Students respond in unison (or individually) with "True" or "False." You can use hand signals (thumbs up/thumbs down), response cards (T/F cards), or simply verbal responses.  
  4. **Discussion (Optional):** For some statements, briefly discuss *why* they are true or false, especially if there's any disagreement.  
  5. **Speed Round:** Once students are comfortable, increase the pace for a quick "speed round."

**Activity 3: Statement Creation Station**

* **Objective:** To encourage students to create their own statements.  
* **Materials:**  
  1. Paper and pencils/crayons.  
  2. (Optional) Objects or pictures to inspire statement creation (e.g., toys, picture cards of animals, fruits, etc.).  
* **Instructions:**  
  1. **Review:** Briefly review the definition of a statement.  
  2. **Prompt:** Give students a prompt, such as:  
     * "Write three statements about this room."  
     * "Write two statements about your favorite animal."  
     * "Look at this picture and write one true statement and one false statement about it."  
     * "Write a statement about something you learned today."  
  3. **Creation:** Students write (or draw, for those who are still developing writing skills) their statements.  
  4. **Sharing (Optional):** Students can share their statements with a partner or the class. The class can then decide if the statements are true or false.  
  5. **Extension:** For students who are ready for a challenge, ask them to write a statement and then write its *opposite* (negation), which will be explored in the next lesson.

These activities provide a multi-sensory, engaging introduction to the concept of statements and truth values, laying a solid foundation for future logic lessons. Remember to keep it light, fun, and encourage student participation and discussion.
